# A Better Number Field For Caldera Forms 1.4.x
Caldera Forms 1.5 will add a number field with great control and filters for min max and step attributes. But right now, there isn't a great option for a field for entering an amount of money with decimals. So you can install this plugin, just make sure to swith to the fancy new number field when 1.5 comes out.
